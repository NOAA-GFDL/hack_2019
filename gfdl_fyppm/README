v0: Original code
v1: first try of OPENACC, with ability to run one GPU for each MPI rank.

to Compile
May need to modify pgi.mk and env.cshrc
source env.cshrc
cd exec.v0 
setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 1
make OPENMP=ON
./fyppm.x

cd exec.v1
make OPENACC=ON
mpirun -np 1 ./fyppm.x  ( will run on one GPU)
mpirun -np 2 ./fyppm.x  ( will run on two MPI ranks, one GPU for each MPI rank)
